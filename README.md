## Project Checklist

### Setup
- [X] Set up base README
- [X] `npm install`, `npm run server`, `npm run client`

### Hints
- Start with what works!
- Start with App files and use props from there. 
- Some components will have varialbles.some will not 
- Header will not need a state

- Use individual state for each image?
- Use toggle for images

- App.jsx --> ListItem.jsx (for each gallery items)
  - Passing props from App.jsx to each ListItem.jsx
